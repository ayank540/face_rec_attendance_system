# Face Recognition Attendance System
This is a small project used to get to know the working of [OpenCV](https://pypi.org/project/opencv-python/) and [face_recognition library](https://pypi.org/project/face-recognition/).
---
In the first phase:
* just created a basic file that imports cv2 and face-recognition
* another one was a csv file to store the attendace of persons who showed their faces to camera
---

Currently:
* worked on connection to database
* storing attendance into database rather than a csv file
* Looking forward to use custom classifier

Still working on improvements...
